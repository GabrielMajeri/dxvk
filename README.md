# D3D9-to-D3D11 converter

This branch contains my WIP code for a D3D9-to-D3D11 converter.

After the discussion in [this pull request](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/541),
I've realized that the project would be better as a separate project, not a DXVK fork.

No further work will happen in this branch.
I am in the process of extracting the code and moving it to a separate repo.
